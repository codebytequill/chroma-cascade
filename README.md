Chroma Cascade

A vibrant, retro-inspired falling block puzzle game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description

Chroma Cascade is a fun and addictive single-player game where the goal is to score points by clearing horizontal lines of blocks. Pieces of different shapes, called tetrominoes, fall from the top of the screen. The player must move and rotate the pieces as they fall to arrange them into solid lines.

How to Play

Objective

Arrange the falling blocks to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps.

When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks above fall to fill the space.

The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen.

Scoring

Points are awarded for each line cleared.

Clearing multiple lines at once (a "Tetris") awards significantly more points.

The game's speed increases as you advance through levels, making it more challenging.
